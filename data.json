This is a giant read, to be sure, but I'm certain that this one is going to be enjoyable and thought-provoking. Because this one is a whopper (1079 pages!), I'm splitting our reading in two. Our first meet up for Part 1 will span from the beginning of the book to page 537, so stop just before the chapter titled \"It Is Starting.\" Can't wait to discuss this with you all!<\/p> <p>\n\n\nA short synopsis:<\/p> <p><b>Infinite Jest<\/b> by David Foster Wallace<\/p> <p>A gargantuan, mind-altering comedy about the pursuit of happiness in America. Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, Infinite Jest explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are. <\/p> <p>Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, Infinite Jest bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human - and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.<\/p> <p>\n\n\nNow let's start reading! <\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Suggested Donation: $2\/attendee<\/b><\/p> <p>As stated in my profile, I'm a broke-ass grad student, and Meetup groups cost money to run (surprise! It’s about $180\/year), so... if you can contribute a buck or two, please do! This increases the likelihood that I can continue this group despite my rotten budget. If you can't, don't sweat it - it wouldn't really be fair to exclude other broke-asses.<\/p> <p><b>A little note on RSVPs:<\/b><\/p> <p>If you have to cancel (life happens sometimes), please do so at least 24 hours in advance. That way space can be freed up for others who may wish to attend, but for whom there wasn't enough room. RSVPs cannot be changed after 9:00am on the day of the event, so be sure to change your RSVP well in advance of this! Also, if you are on the waiting list and other's change their RSVP to \"no\", you will be bumped up on the list, so make sure to check your status the day of the event. If you RSVP \"yes\" and don't show up 3 times (yes, I will be counting!), you will be excluded from future attendance. This is only fair for others who want to attend the meetings.<\/p> <p>RSVPs for all meetings open up at 7:00pm on the evening of the previous meeting. This prevents folks from signing up for all available future meetings, forgetting that they did so, and then not showing up - which means that others wouldn't be able to attend! So please be patient when signing up.

is a description of a service not a meetup.We do have meetups on our page).<\/p> <p>Whether you are a veteran, novice or intermediate, Chriss can help you on your personal, soul and professional path in developing, refining, transforming and strengthening your vibration (and your medicine).<\/p> <p>Chriss is uncanny in ability to connect with and to see what is, what's off, what's missing, and in assisting the next step. Healers and sensitives of all kinds have benefited from working with chriss, affecting their lives in every dimension, from personal to professional and emotional and spiritual.<\/p> <p>In my first visit it was clear to me that Chriss was an angel, a soul I had manifested to be an ally in my life journey. I signed up for 3 months worth of sessions and little did I know how transformational they would be. In the 12 weeks I gained so much knowledge about myself, my patterns, health, culture, communication, and how to listen to my spirit and intuition. I went through a lot of unlearning and relearning, unloading and nourishing, thanks to his gentle yet empowering guidance, meditation, and shamanic medicine and energy work. He has such a strong desire for others to reach their optimum health mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. He has vast amounts of information that he is always happy to share. I have gained so much from working with him and will never be able to go back to the defeated person I used to be.\"<\/p> <p>\"From the start, you saw right through. I couldn't get away with anything with you. Every type of healer I had been to over the past 2 decades were nothing compared to you, your work and what You helped me do with my life. Thank you immensely.\"<\/p> <p>“You are the amazing one – a true healer, a grand spirit who has helped me to see the TRUE nature of my spirit and in doing so, you set me free.”<\/p> <p>\"Working with Chriss is like having an exceptionally skilled and capable mirror in my life advocating for me. I felt held in compassion and safe within to share myself because of the safe space he held for me to be heard. Experiencing his energy medicine was like the sensation of being enveloped back inside the womb and I felt I could see, feel and experience being in an experience of Divine Love. He is the most powerful mirror I have had of what true unconditional love really is and through him, I learned to really love and respect myself and hold compassion for who I am, instead of living in shame, regret and judgment of myself. I am able to really understand and know myself and frame my “story” in a light of the beautiful being that I AM because Chriss helped me to realize and live my truth. Chriss is a true healer, compassionate heart, and friend on my journey through life.”<\/p> <p>“Chriss’s presence in my healing has helped me to regenerate renewal and energy into my life. In the physical realm, I have experienced a dramatic decrease in inflammation, pain and sluggish metabolism\/ energy through Chriss’s Reiki healing. Spiritually, his counseling has opened up a true “awakening” in me and this awakening has given birth to a lifelong commitment to a right and true relationship with the universe. The space that Chriss creates for his clients is a safe haven in which to open up in. Because of this, I have been able to work through past hurts, patterns of behavior, and reignite a deep compassion for myself and others. Through deep listening and fruitful counseling methods, he has helped me to be an active participant in my healing process. Being in the presence of such a spirit as Chriss has helped me to begin the process of freeing my mind from years of self-judgment, guilt and shame. The benefits of this practice have revealed so many new possibilities in my life. His gentle soul serves as a “mirror” to mine and this mirroring has helped to facilitate deep self realization, opening of awareness, and connection to my source. In my experience, his healing abilities have gone beyond what we normally look to in therapy or energy healing and transcended into a very effective transformative healing of my mind, body and spirit.”<\/p> <p> <\/p> <p>Call for an easy low key conversation today to meet and talk about our lives.<\/p> <p>Warmly,<\/p> <p>Chriss<\/p> <p><br\/>[masked]<br\/>website: wholebeinghealing.com<br\/>[masked]<\/p> <p>other client comments:<\/p> <p>\"In 20 years in this business, I've never seen anything like it!\"<br\/>\"I'm in total bliss.

For those of you who like the outdoors, and want to experience yoga outside, class will resume next Sunday.  Weather permitting, we will be meeting for outdoor yoga on *most* Sundays.   As a new teacher, I am looking forward to sharing yoga with you and creating queer community.<\/p> <p>This is an all levels class with a focus on being in your body with little strain and a lot of healing breath.  It is a body positive space, and I always ask before assisting someone in a pose.  Because it is an all levels class, please feel free to up-level or ask for assistance if you need it.  If you are new to yoga, please don't give up after the first few times!  It took me years to start seeing the benefits of this practice, and the benefits keep showing up!  <\/p> <p>Props are also welcomed though not necessary (block, strap, etc).   *Please do bring a mat* --If you happen to forget, I will always bring along one extra mat, but I encourage you to bring your own mat if at all possible. Expect to get your mat a little bit dirty, as we are outside on a grassy lawn. <\/p> <p>We will meet at the circular fountain, which you can see as you enter the cemetery from Piedmont Avenue. I was trained in Forrest Yoga, which is a style created by Ana Forrest. She is a powerful and spiritual woman who suffered many injuries and an eating disorder, and healed herself with this style of yoga. It is gentle on the body, and a lot about listening to your body's inner wisdom. I recommend her book, Fierce Medicine, if you are curious about her style of yoga.

It is now getting a well-deserved U.S. release, and richly repays the wait. Like Farhadi’s other films, it is full of subtle motivations and believable characters, building intense emotional involvement as the story unfolds. Beautiful Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani, The Patience Stone, Exodus: Gods and Kings), is a friendly young wife and mother with a tendency to stretch the truth to try to make things better. She arranges a weekend getaway to the seashore with three couples who were friends at university, with their young children, and includes Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini), the newly-divorced brother of one of them, home from Germany looking for a wife. She also invites, with considerable arm-twisting, Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti), the sweet but shy kindergarten teacher of her daughter, to get acquainted with Ahmad. Everyone is having a good time until tragedy suddenly strikes, with a mysterious disappearance. Recriminations ensue and relationships are strained. The friends try to cover up the truth, and lie piles upon lie leading to disaster.

Happy to answer any questions you may have, via email or phone.<\/p> <p>Warm Wishes,<\/p> <p>Ira Marlowe (host)<\/p> <p>THE WORD PARTY is a weekly drop-in class focusing on improvisational writing and other writing-related games and exercises.<\/p> <p>Partly based on the work of Julia Cameron (\"The Artist's Way\") and Natalie Goldberg (\"Writing Down the Bones\"), our goal is to help stimulate creativity and help generate new ideas. We offer a friendly, humorous environment for anyone who enjoys writing and we're open to writers of all levels.<\/p> <p>Each session features a variety of writing games and assignments lasting between five and twenty minutes. By writing non-stop, without lifting pen from paper (or fingers from keys), the internal critic is silenced and the unconscious mind gets a welcome chance to play. (You may be amazed at what you come up with!)<\/p> <p>Afterward, participants have the option of sharing what they've written. However, you are never under any pressure to do so.<\/p> <p>I believe you will find this an enjoyable resource for fiction writers, journal-keepers, poets, dramatists, comedians, and songwriters.
