As eclipses move through the houses of the natal chart and aspect natal planets, they describe where you’re currently confronting developmental crisis. Which natal patterns currently demand your attention and willingness to change? When have you confronted similar challenges in the past — and how might you handle them more effectively in the present?  The lecture includes interpretations of eclipses in natal houses and in aspect to natal planets.</p> <p><b>April Elliott Kent  </b>has been a professional astrologer since 1990.

We are officially moving to the epic tale of Wizard of the Coast's Tyranny of Dragons. This is a two part adventure that will take us into some high level adventures by the end of book two. First off this is a well-supported campaign extravaganza by WotC. Here is their <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/story\">faq / online compendium</a> to the module.  You can watch the video to get you in the epic mood of dragon-slaying… or merely fighting and fleeing. </p> <p>For new players, here's an <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd\">overview of the game</a> to help get familiar with the world, races, and classes.  For everyone, the <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules\">new 5e rules</a> are out and we will be using them for this adventure.</p> <p><br/>Here are the guidelines to creating a new character:</p> <p>• Start at level 4 </p> <p>• Follow the instructions on the book to create your character starting from page 10.</p> <p>• You may either follow the rules to roll 4d6 and take the best 3 for your stats or take the array of:  15, 14, 13, 12, 10,8. </p> <p><br/>What to bring:</p> <p>• Your printed character sheets, we want to keep this analog.</p> <p>• A set of 7 die dice!  You can get these online or somewhere like Gamescape.</p> <p>• A pencil w/ an eraser and some extra paper. </p> <p>Feel free to contact me, if you need any help making characters or have questions in regards to the meetup. </p> <p>If we have less then three players, we will have to cancel the game. One to Two players just won't be a fun game for all involved and will require too much adjustments from the campaign material for the DM.</p>","how_to_find_us":"in the back, look for dice","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/d204life/events/222410031/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"name":"Tyranny of Dragons","id":"tgrxflythblc","time":1432864800000,"updated":1432321571000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398574311000,"name":"Downtown D&D","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"id":14128332,"urlname":"d204life","group_lat":37.790000915527344,"who":"Heroes"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"2051 Market Street","name":"Eros","lon":-122.42762,"id":17885012,"state":"CA","lat":37.76812,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.13818645477295,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426010263000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Erotic Self Exploration Night at EROS </p> <p>Every Thursday night from 7:00pm to 8:00pm </p> <p>Join us at Eros for a unique event that puts the focus on getting to know yourself.Intentional breath, self touch, movement and imagery will be used to take you on a journey deeper into your erotic self.

That way I can demonstrate the range of riding positions and the range of ergonomic adjustments you can do to your bike. Find out how certain riding styles and poor bike setup can be hazardous and how to solve them. The end result is you being more comfortable on your bike with less fatigue and having more fun!</p> <p>The ergonomics part of this workshop will cover how to adjust your bike to your body and style of riding. The ergonomics of different bike types and body types will be addressed and participants will have a working knowledge of what do do with their bikes adjustments.Optimize your bike for your riding style.

Both consumers and developers of native apps have very high levels of expectations in terms of how an application should look and behave. One common pattern to achieve consistent design and interaction consists of reusing a set of UI components throughout the application. The main benefits of this pattern are consistency and rapid development. One downside, however is that it makes it harder to visually validate the impact of code changes on transactions. For example, a small change to fix the interaction response or visually adjust a component on one page can impact multiple transactions within the application. And, when major OS updates arrive from Apple/Google, unexpected visual and interaction-related changes can occur.</p> <p><br/>To balance this out, developers need an automated way to catch visual regressions as OS versions change or code is committed. Multi-faceted visual testing also reduces manual QA time by eliminating the need for comparing one build against another and increases testing coverage by ensuring those less-frequently used parts of the application are verified. In this Meetup you will hear how we integrated visual testing into our build pipeline and learn more about the combination of tools we are using. We will also discuss the pros and cons of each tool and how to leverage their strengths.</p> <p>\n\n\nAgenda</p> <p>6:30 - 7:00 Networking</p> <p>7:00 - 7:10 Welcome and Introductions</p> <p>7:10 - 7:40 Speaker</p> <p>7:40 - 8:00 Q &amp; A</p> <p>8:00 - 8:30 More Networking</p>","how_to_find_us":"160 Spear Street 17 Floor, San Francisco, CA (Open Kitchen area)","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Smart-Applications-Web-and-Native/events/221193275/","yes_rsvp_count":72,"name":"Automated Visual Regression Testing and Analysis in Native Apps","id":"221193275","time":1432863000000,"updated":1428951016000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1423285326000,"name":"Smart Applications - Web and Native","group_lon":-121.93000030517578,"id":18417094,"urlname":"Smart-Applications-Web-and-Native","group_lat":37.709999084472656,"who":"UXers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94518","country":"us","city":"Concord","address_1":"2175 Willow Pass Rd","name":"Todos Santos Plaza","lon":-122.03321,"id":286633,"state":"CA","lat":37.977036,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":14.904948234558105,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428605016000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Thursday, May 28, 6:30 to 8:00 p.m.</p> <p>Todos Santos Music and Farmers Market - Concord High Jazz Band</p> <p>Downtown Concord</p> <p><br/>Patrick Perez (925)[masked]</p> <p>[masked]</p> <p>This band performs every year in May and they are great.

If you've ever wanted to try rock climbing, this is an ideal chance to try it in a safe environment with experienced climbers.  Whether you can barely climb a ladder or you're flashing 5.13's there's something for everyone and we're very supportive of climbers at all levels - no one starts out climbing 5.11s.  Members are welcome to bring 2 guests.  This is a very popular event and is limited to 30 climbers, so let's please have zero no-shows. </p> <p><b>If you are new to climbing, please arrive at 6:15 and be geared up and fully ready to go by 6:30</b> as I'll give all new climbers about a 45 minute intro on tying in correctly, belaying, safety, etc.  After my intro class you'll take the Mission Cliffs safety test (takes 5 minutes, 100% of people I've trained first have passed).  After you've passed your test, we'll have plenty of time to climb as a group.  I'll be available to give you finer points on technique at this point as well. </p> <p>If you're not a member of Mission Cliffs, it's $20 for a day pass (or $100 for a 1 month pass) plus $5 for shoe/harness rentals.  Thursday night the gym is open until 11 so we'll have plenty of time to climb.  Likely around 10 we'll split, for those that want to join me I'm gonna grab dinner and a beer nearby.</p> <p>Mission Cliffs make staffing decisions based on how many climbers we bring, and they often have an additional person working to help accommodate our group.  For that reason <b>it's essential that you keep your rsvp status up to date.  Mission Cliffs has been unbelievable cool to us, let's respect that relationship by giving them an accurate rsvp count</b>.  It's fine if you sign up the day of the event, but no-shows are not cool at this event (and in general) and will be recorded as such.</p> <p>Hit me up with any questions, otherwise I'll see you Thursday night!  Do not send me funds, you'll pay for your own day pass Thursday night in person.</p> <p><b>Meeting Location:  Just upstairs from the weight lifting area.</b></p> <p><b>Release of Liability:</b></p> <p>By joining us for this event you hereby RELEASE and DISCHARGE it's owners, principals, affiliates, presenters, organizer, hosts and participants from any and all liability, claims, demands or causes of action that you now have, or may have in the future, for injuries, damages, death and/or economic loss of any kind or nature, arising in whole or in part out of the activities, advice or information contained herein</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Out-And-Outdoors/events/222467406/","yes_rsvp_count":14,"name":"Indoor Rock Climbing - Beginners Welcome","id":"222467406","time":1432863000000,"updated":1431389044000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1329333672000,"name":"Bay Area Out & Outdoors","group_lon":-122.44000244140625,"id":3300092,"urlname":"Bay-Area-Out-And-Outdoors","group_lat":37.7599983215332,"who":"Outdoor Adventurers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94102","country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"567 Sutter St","name":"567 Sutter St","lon":-122.409592,"id":8142762,"state":"Ca","lat":37.789036,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":10,"headcount":0,"distance":9.470582008361816,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430373869000,"fee":{"amount":49,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Price","required":"1"},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/79484859\" class=\"embedded\">https://vimeo.com/79484859</a></p> <p><b>~~~</b></p> <p><b>This is a weekly 2 hour class that takes place at Sandbox Suites Union Square. </b></p> <p><b>~~~</b></p> <p>Finance is a powerful global force and valuation lies at its core.

Next, we delve into the details of how Tachyon helps accelerate our Big Data Analytics pipeline at its current state. At the end, we discuss what new features we want to see and the plan to scale further. Hear from <b><a href=\"http://www.baidu.com/\">Baidu</a></b> who will share lessons learned from Tachyon deployments in production as well as <b><a href=\"http://www.tachyonnexus.com/\">Tachyon Nexus</a></b> who will share exciting news related to Tachyon.</p> <p>Tachyon recent development: Tachyon 0.6.4 was recently released, with significant improvements to the overall system. This talk will touch on the features recently developed on Tachyon, including the alpha release of Tiered Storage in 0.64.  Haoyuan Li is founder and CEO of Tachyon Nexus. He is also a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate in AMPLab at UC Berkeley, where he co-created Tachyon, an open memory-centric distributed system. He is a founding committer of Apache Spark.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>06:00-06:30  -  Food and Networking<br/>06:30-07:30  -  Presentations<br/>07:30-07:45  -  Q&amp;A<br/>07:45-08:00  -  Thank you for attending</p> <p><br/>See you there!</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/BayAreaAnalytics/events/222505888/","yes_rsvp_count":79,"duration":7200000,"name":"Fast Big Data Analytics with Spark on Tachyon in Baidu","id":"222505888","time":1432861200000,"updated":1431531551000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1359231944000,"name":"Bay Area Analytics","group_lon":-122.33000183105469,"id":6857382,"urlname":"BayAreaAnalytics","group_lat":37.54999923706055,"who":"Quants and Data Gurus"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"US","city":"San Leandro","address_1":"101 Parrott St","name":"Englander Sports Pub","lon":-122.153778,"id":19088072,"lat":37.72224,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.044897079467773,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1429677740000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Folks,</p> <p>We have an action packed, exciting and interesting event planned for May 28th.

Pitching slots go quickly, so sign up early!</p> <p><b>To Present a Pitch </b></p> <p>You must register in advance; presenters are assigned on a first-come basis and slot availability is confirmed</p> <p><i>automatically during registration</i>; the maximum number of presenters is 10, plus 4 ‘no guarantee’ Standby slots.</p> <p><i>Once you register additional guidelines will be sent. You must RSVP receipt.</i> Your pitch is two minutes, <i>timing is strictly enforced</i>, no handouts, cards, demos or samples allowed during or immediately after your presentation.</p> <p>Your pitch is followed by 4 minutes of Q&amp;A by the panel; and 4 minutes of non-rebuttal feedback from each panelist. Only one person from the company may present the (2) minute pitch to the investors and answer questions from the panel.</p> <p><i>Entrepreneurs not yet ready to pitch or unable to reserve a pitch slot are encouraged register and attend.</i>  By listening to the pitches, the Q&amp;A, and the critiques you learn the key points required to develop an effective pitch that investors value. You also have the opportunity to network with investors person to person at the event.</p> <p><b>If you are an investor</b>, come and listen to the entrepreneurs’ pitches—you never know where you’ll find your next deal. Learn how other investors rate the pitches; which Angels pass and for what reasons; and which entrepreneurs other Angels want to talk to ASAP.  </p> <p><b>If you are interested in serving on a Pitch or Workshop panel please contact </b><a href=\"mailto:[masked]\"><b>Valerie Badgett</b></a><b>, Program Manager.</b></p> <p>Moderator: David Emerson, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbsalumniangels.com%2F\">Harvard Business School Alumni Angeles</a></p> <p>Panelists: <br/>Assim Gupta, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.keiretsuforum.com%2F\">Keiretsu Forum</a> <br/>Alison Wellsfry <br/>Ronald Weissman, <a href=\"http://www.bandangels.com/\">Band of Angels</a><br/>Darnell Kemp, <a href=\"https://dreamfunded.com/\">Dreamfunded</a><br/>Steve Wurzburg, <a href=\"http://www.pillsburylaw.com\">Pillsbury Law</a></p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/VC-Taskforce/events/222246015/","yes_rsvp_count":11,"duration":9000000,"name":"Seed-Stage Investor Elevator Pitch","id":"222246015","time":1432861200000,"updated":1432249119000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1370642845000,"name":"VC Taskforce","group_lon":-122.1500015258789,"id":8830252,"urlname":"VC-Taskforce","group_lat":37.439998626708984,"who":"Members"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"San Jose","address_1":"This is an event with cover charge","name":"Please sign up at Eventbrite to get directions.","lon":0,"id":23846085,"state":"CA","lat":0,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.300843238830566,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432099252000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pitch-to-harvard-angels-and-fenox-capital-coinvestors-with-y-combinator-ron-conway-sierra-ventures-tickets-17017837811?aff=yw59\">Click Here To Register At Eventbrite</a> </b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pitch-to-harvard-angels-and-fenox-capital-coinvestors-with-y-combinator-ron-conway-sierra-ventures-tickets-17017837811?aff=yw59\"><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pitch-to-harvard-angels-and-fenox-capital-coinvestors-with-y-combinator-ron-conway-sierra-ventures-tickets-17017837811?aff=yw59\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pitch-to-harvard-angels-and-fenox-capital-coinvestors-with-y-combinator-ron-conway-sierra-ventures-tickets-17017837811?aff=yw59</a></a> </b></p> <p><b>The event starts with a Networking Reception (food, refreshments and networking). </b></p> <p><b>AGENDA:</b></p> <p><b>6:00pm - 6:45pm - food, drinks, networking and demo/sponsor tables</b></p> <p><b>6:45pm - 7:00PM - introductions and welcoming remarks</b></p> <p><b>7:00pm - 8:30pm - pitches and feedback from the panel</b></p> <p><b>8:30pm - Lifograph Pitch Prize winner is announced</b></p> <p><b>8:35pm - Meeting the speakers and networking, demo/sponsor tables</b></p> <p><b>9:00pm - event ends</b></p> <p><br/>WHO SHOULD ATTEND: </p> <p>Startups looking for funding are invited to pitch.</p> <p>You may also attend as a spectator and take advantage of a great learning and networking opportunity.</p> <p>FORMAT:</p> <p>90-second pitch followed by feedback from the investor(s). </p> <p>LIFOGRAPH PITCH WINNER PRIZE: </p> <p>The panel will choose a winner who will receive a FREE TICKET AND A SPONSOR TABLE at an upcoming Lifograph event scheduled in the next 30 days.

As you know, this is one of the reason why we are opening up a shop here. Most importantly, we felt the need and responsibility to share more knowledge about manufacturing, about the hot and sweaty markets in Huaqiangbei, and about China. Therefore, we are putting together another event for you with O'Reilly Media on <b>Shenzhen's hardware ecosystem</b> as we have the honor to invite Mr Terry Cheng to share his insights with us. </p> <p>Because of our cohost, for more details, please click on the link below and RSVP through Eventbrite.

Featuring the Connected mobile app as an in-depth case study of how to combine compute-intensive features describing billions of relationships with information that isn’t known until the moment a user opens the app, in this talk we’ll discuss the architectural, modeling, and experimentation patterns leveraged by the Connected relevance team to rank and serve mobile content. Additionally, this session will touch on the human element of machine learning product development, outlining collaboration and communication patterns for working effectively across the organization – from reporting and documentation to evangelism, skills transfer and user experience research. Taken together, these insights will provide a detailed picture of some of LinkedIn’s best practices for building data products at a global scale.</p> <p><b>Bio:<br/></b>Mike Conover builds machine learning technologies that leverage the behavior and relationships of hundreds of millions of people.

And after the net neutrality order, it matters to the FCC, an aggressive, new player in the privacy enforcement ecosystem.</p> <p>On the flipside, trust, one of the goals of privacy, can be a competitive advantage that distinguishes a company from competitors, increases brand awareness, and catapults user loyalty. So why do companies keep slipping up? Often there isn’t any legal or regulatory guidance for new technology and/or new uses of data. So how do you navigate the uncharted waters of emerging tech &amp; uncertain law?</p> <p>Join our interactive workshop to find out what you should do, what your peers would do, and what regulators have done in the past. Finally, we’ll apply our newfound privacy know-how to a new emerging tech ecosystem.</p> <p>Location: TRUSTe HQ: 835 Market Street, Suite 800 Contact: Matthew Coleman, [masked]</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>6:00pm - 6:30pm: Kick back and make nice with privacy professionals<br/>6:30pm - 7:15pm: Workshop - Applied Privacy: Navigating the Uncharted Waters of Emerging Tech &amp; Uncertain Law<br/>7:15pm - 7:30pm: Q&amp;A<br/>7:30pm - 8:00pm: Continued networking</p> <p>Meet our speaker: Timothy Yim<br/>Timothy Yim, CIPP/US, CIPT, CIPM, is Director of Data &amp; Privacy at the Startup Policy Lab, where he directs research and policy initiatives in the data privacy and emerging technology space—pushing forward data-driven policies that drive global innovation.

We have planted over 1,250 trees so far.</p> <p><b>What:</b> Planting trees requested by Oakland homeowners (or schools, libraries, or parks).</p> <p><br/><b>Who:</b> You and your friends. No experience is needed, and we also welcome people who aren’t Sierra Club members. We will organize you into teams of three or four, including at least one experienced planter to lead each team. You should be able to lift 30 pounds (half of the weight of a new tree).  Wear closed-toed shoes, clothes that you won’t mind getting dirty, and a hat for sun protection; bring your own water and a snack. We provide the shovels, picks, brooms, and gloves.</p> <p><b>How:</b> Dig a hole, remove the tree from its pot and put it into the ground, backfill the soil around the roots, and sweep the sidewalk clean. Most teams can plant 3 – 5 trees in four hours. (Don't worry; we'll teach you whatever you don't know.) Other Sierra Club volunteers will do some follow-up work, such as placing a steel stake to help support a newly planted tree.</p> <p><b>Where:</b> The trees may be anywhere in Oakland, but first we organize into teams at[masked]nd St. in north Oakland (at Shattuck Ave, near Ashby BART). You can bike or walk to the meeting place. But if you have a car or truck, please consider bringing it to the meeting place, so you can take other volunteers and supplies to your team's planting sites.</p> <p><b>When:</b> Saturday mornings, 9 am to 1 pm, November through June. Join us as often as you like. Teams will leave the meeting place shortly after 9. If it is raining heavily, we won’t meet on that day.</p> <p>For more information or to join our Tree Team mailing list, contact Arthur Boone, Tree Team lead, at [masked] or (510) 910-6451.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/sanfranciscobay/events/222403814/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":14400000,"name":"Plant trees in Oakland!","id":"wdkxglythbnc","time":1433001600000,"updated":1431120394000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1330469704000,"name":"San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club","group_lon":-122.27999877929688,"id":3384822,"urlname":"sanfranciscobay","group_lat":37.869998931884766,"who":"Members"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94707","country":"us","city":"Albany","address_1":"Marin Ave & Ordway St, Albany, CA 94707","name":"Marin Ave & Ordway St, Albany, CA 94707","lon":-122.283524,"id":13922172,"state":"Ca","lat":37.889198,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.520901083946228,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1384013421000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>This is a walk with a gentle incline in the first half and options to extend the walk.

Met some great professionals last time we organized a hike. The 40 plus hour a week desk job has become the new \"smoking\" which makes it ESSENTIAL to MAKE time for working out. Making time for yourself to exercise is something a lot of us tend to push to the side, its something we tend to see as something we should do, not something we must. We rarely do what we should do but always do what we must so knowing that, exercise has to be something we feel like we must do, 510 Hikers is the place to reinvent how you spend your Saturday morning and become your Saturday morning \"must\" do. We consistently bring 100 plus active Black Professionals out EACH WEEK to challenge, support, encourage and share. The hike group has encouraged thousands to get on the trails, nothing like sunshine, mother nature and tons of smiling faces to bask in. This week hike is 5.4 miles and we follow that up with an optional 10 minute yoga session/stretch.</p> <p>Please bring at least 24oz of water (actually a sports drink will be even better). No water, no hike (this is not the hike to walk with your Starbucks Latte, we work on the trails and we want to burn calories).  KIND sponsors the entire team so there will be plenty of free KIND bars, but please bring a couple snacks to offer quick energy boosts when feeling depleted. Also, please come on time, I know, I know, trust me, we start on time, don't want to leave anyone. Parking is metered, please bring quarters or credit cards to feed the meter (you will want two hours).</p> <p> </p> <p>Feel free to bring kids, n strollers please, however, if your kid can hang, great, we have usually 5/6 of them every hike so don't let you child convince you to leave them home in front of the Playstation, bring them!!!!</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/eastbayblackprof/events/222805046/","yes_rsvp_count":6,"name":"510 Hikers meets East Bay Black Professionals!!","id":"222805046","time":1432997100000,"updated":1432765452000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1215712715000,"name":"East Bay Black Professionals Association","group_lon":-122.29000091552734,"id":1218322,"urlname":"eastbayblackprof","group_lat":37.810001373291016,"who":"Black Professionals"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"distance":10.322858810424805,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432401343000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>-Alamere Falls Hike-</b></p> <p><b><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JHuVlKJsWw3FzTzUt_1qx4iyKYuOdWfZwMxcq-G8_Uw/edit?usp=sharing\">CARPOOL LINK</a></b> 2 Spots IKEA in Emeryville at 4400 Shellmound, or Shopping Center at 16th &amp; Portrero in SF</p> <p><b>The Meetup Spot: (Trailhead) Meet at Trailhead at 9:15am.</b></p> <p>Carpool Fee from SF is $10. We will meet PaloMarin Trailhead (end of Mesa Rd in Point Reyes, Ca).  This is a winding road with cyclists.  Please allow plenty of time for driving.  Park on the left-hand side of the road.  We will gather at the trail head in the parking lot.</p> <p><b>The Hike Plan:</b> </p> <p>Alamere Falls has to be one of my favorite hikes in the bay area. You start from the Palomarin Trail Head-Alamere Falls (check the parking signs -- they will give you a ticket!). The hike to Alamere takes you along the coast trail with some spectacular views, then inland through the forested area, the past Bass Lake which you can check out and finally to the Falls. The hike down to the falls is not maintained and pretty much just all loose slate, so wear some aggressive tread or be prepared to slip and fall (and if you do, don't worry, you wont be the only one :)). Finally getting to the beach and looking up at the falls is truly magical. Check the weather first and make sure to go on a fully sunny day for the best experience. I'd say this is moderate difficulty and is great for couples, groups, or just solo.  </p> <p><b>What to bring:</b></p> <p>Good hiking boots/shoes; hat; sunscreen; backpack, at least 1 liter of water and camera too, if you’re a photog. DRESS IN LAYERS and wear long pants!  Weather can be unpredictable, so have layers that you can shed.  Food to eat; there is no food for purchase along the way.  Consider…dried fruit/nuts/seeds, chips, dips, salsa, wraps, meats/cheeses, sliced sandwiches, salads, cheese/crackers, - be creative!</p> <p><b>Tips for an enjoyable hike: </b> </p> <p>• Carry more water than you than you think you’ll drink – 2 liters is best. </p> <p>• Fill your water bottles half way night prior, then top off in the am.</p> <p>• Bring a paper or plastic bag for your trash. Pack it in-pack it out.  We don’t leave trash on the trail. </p> <p>• Bring some cash for a possible post-hike lunch.  </p> <p>• Bring post hiking shoes.  Your feet will thank you. </p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/NorCalSnowboarders-SF/events/222733233/","yes_rsvp_count":45,"duration":27000000,"name":"-Alamere Falls Hike-","id":"222733233","time":1432996200000,"updated":1432778633000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1287167303000,"name":"NorCal Snowboarders: SF","group_lon":-122.41000366210938,"id":1722633,"urlname":"NorCalSnowboarders-SF","group_lat":37.77000045776367,"who":"Boarders/Skiers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"distance":22.238117218017578,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1426478407000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Surfing, without a doubt, is good for the body and soul.

Then there are those whose grooves are infused with painstakingly produced little details and a sense of wonderment that reaches beyond beyond mere dancefloor functionality. Whether he’s producing thumping techno or downtempo chillout, David Gtronic’s sense of musicality always shines through.</p> <p>He is largely known for what he likes to term “aggressive”, hard grooving techno - but it’s those obscured flourishes of organic elements that colour his sound which really set him apart from the pack. Captivating releases that he’s released on labels such as Suara, Monique Musique, Kina Music, Serkal, Oblack and Moan Recordings and remixes for the likes of Santos and Yaya have found support from the likes of techno deities including Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Loco Dice and Dubfire. His Terrace Podcast has grown since launching in August 2008 to reach almost 1,000,000 downloads in total, showcasing his eclectic and carefully-crafted journey-style DJ sets to listeners across the world. Whatever he puts his hands to, it’s always imbued with the sense of musical mysticism and contrast between the natural and the artificial that he strives to bring to life. David relishes the challenge of crafting techno that reveals itself gradually to the careful listener, emotions embossed into his pounding rhythms by way of subtle textures and melodies that lay deep beneath the surface. His mesmerising collaborative mini-album with Dutch producer Lilith, Lagrimas Del Sol, recently demonstrated his prowess in marrying eclectic, traditional sounds to complex dancefloor grooves, with pianos, cellos and much more woven into this fascinating musical tapestry. Created over the course of several months between their respective homes of Miami and Amsterdam and working with some of Europe’s most revered session musicians, it represented a new high in his career arc and boldly underlined his desire to create sonic artefacts that set themselves apart from run-of-the-mill formulaic dance music. With his more recent EP alongside Romanian stars Livio &amp; Roby and his collaboration with Santos, David Gtronic’s stock has risen further still, with each release continuing to cement his reputation as one of techno’s more adventurous and musically-minded producers.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/MUZAMI-House-Tech-House-Techno-Show-Meetup/events/222688341/","yes_rsvp_count":13,"duration":21600000,"name":"Max Cooper, Simon Baker, David Gtronic & Chad Andrew @ Public Works","id":"222688341","time":1432962000000,"updated":1432219909000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1369188565000,"name":"MUZAMI (House, Tech House, Techno Show Meetup)","group_lon":-122.44000244140625,"id":8590012,"urlname":"MUZAMI-House-Tech-House-Techno-Show-Meetup","group_lat":37.779998779296875,"who":"Music Lovers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94103","country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"446 Valencia","name":"StageWerx Theater","lon":-122.422134,"id":9776262,"state":"CA","lat":37.765781,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":11.01334285736084,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1350070673000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Reservation (highly recommended): <a href=\"http://freecomedyfridays.eventbrite.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://freecomedyfridays.eventbrite.com/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Note: The theater tends to hit capacity so if you have not made reservations you can come early to line up at the wait list (first come first serve!)

Now, they say behind every stripper there is a person... Hahaa that was the first joke. Strippers, some people love them, some people hate them, some people pay them money to get naked. Well we've hired one to come on down and let us roast them! Oh and don't worry Ember is hella cool, down to be roasted, is going to have friends there, and yea just because she's a stripper doesn't mean she can't tell a mean joke. This show will be as much about razzing strippers in general as it is about mocking those who, for some reason, hate them.

The earlier part of the evening is ideal for families with kids.</p> <p>We play all sorts of board games and card games on Friday nights, but also:</p> <p>Got a <b>favorite game</b> you'd like to find others to play? Bring it along!

(Plus we have a separate Meetup for each every Sunday; for details see chess <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/North-Oakland-Chess-Club/\">here</a> and Go <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/North-Oakland-Go-Club/\">here</a>.)</p> <p>Very recently we've added <b>Magic the Gathering</b> every Friday (reserved table in the back) and on Thursdays too, hosted by Jimmy Freeman and both starting at 7:00 PM.

A one-night-stand turns into week after week of makeovers as Vivian is transformed into the woman that Edward thinks he wants. Director Garry Marshall took what might have been a sordid hackneyed parody of Pygmalion and turned it into a sweet, innocent, and warm-hearted tale of love and redemption. Julia Robert's performance as an utterly adorable hooker-with-a-heart launched her into Hollywood's A-List and the chemistry between her and Richard Gere made this film easily the most memorable romantic comedy of the 1990s.

Then we usually share a short inspirational story or have a discussion about a current event going on in the world. After that, we hear a new Buddhist lesson each week. At the end, there is usually time to answer any questions or give feedback. We have a wide array of topics like dealing with anger, discovering your true self, parables taught by the Buddha, and most importantly achieving your purpose of life!</p> <p>Hope to see you online soon...

Keep it impersonal. </p> <p> Give the type of feedback you would like to receive. </p> <p> Give praise where praise is due. </p> <p> Know that praise is not enough; feedback for improvement of the content is also required. Use the \"sandwich\" technique. (good, not-so-hot, good) </p> <p> Be clear in your comments; provide specific examples and suggestions for improvements. </p> <p> Do not be tempted to rewrite for the writer. Examples are appropriate. </p> <p>Be sincere. Be kind.</p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Check out the Mill Valley Library’s Writers Salon page for more programs and services for writers.  <a href=\"http://www.mvplwriterssalon.wordpress.com/\">www.mvplwriterssalon.wordpress.com</a></p>","how_to_find_us":"The Mill Valley Library's Writers' Drop-In is held at the Mill Valley Public Library, nestled in the beautiful redwoods at the base of Mt.

Birthing New Beginnings – Spring  May 29 - 31, 2015</b></p> <p>We begin to Walk the Spiral Path in the East within a Safe and Sacred Community. Honoring the Cycles of Nature, we enter the Labyrinth of Transformation in the Spring, the Time of new beginnings and the dawning of a new way to Be in the world.</p> <p>Our journey starts with our Intention and Imagination to vision our path and our highest possibility. We discover and connect with our helping spirits and guides in a process that continues throughout our journey. Spending time with Nature and the land, we begin to reconnect and remember our place in Nature and with All our Relations.</p> <p>We find our personal Creation story and experience the deep love from which we were created, and in ceremony we experience our Birth to this Earth Walk. We begin the Foundation initiation Rites of the Munay-Ki, energetic transmissions distilled from ancient shamanic rites from the Q’ero nation of Peru, to create new energetic architecture to grow into our new Selves. We walk the path to our personal transformation and to awaken our healing power and presence.</p> <p><b>Follow-up Conference Call TBA July 2015</b></p> <p><b>2. Growing and Blossoming – Summer  August 21 - 23, 2015</b></p> <p>We continue our Journey with a turn of the wheel along The Spiral Path, Growing and Blossoming into Summer, Honoring the South. We come together to deepen Community and Grow our Potential.</p> <p>With Concentration and Focus we find and clear the old stories that keep us bound to the past, identifying with our history and trapped in unhealthy patterns. Honoring what has been and finding the gifts in these experiences we unleash fuel for our journey of growth and blossoming. </p> <p>Re-inventing ourselves, we shed the old worn out ways of walking in the world. We find our new power through our Spirit Animal Ally and our Power Song. We complete the Foundation initiation Rites of the Munay-Ki, energetic transmissions distilled from ancient shamanic rites from the Q’ero nation of Peru, to create new energetic architecture to grow into our new Selves.</p> <p>Follow-up Conference Call  TBA October 2015</p> <p><b>3. Harvesting the Fruits – Fall  December 11 - 13, 2015</b></p> <p>We continue our Journey with another turn of the wheel along the Spiral Path, Maturing into Fall, Honoring the West. We return to rekindle and harvest the gifts of Community. We honor and integrate what is in Shadow. </p> <p>We come into Harmony by owning our Shadow aspects: from our lives, our ancestral lineages, our karmic legacy. We honor the shadow as a healing energy embodied in the dark of the Moon cycle. Releasing the fear of the shadow and bindings from the past, we can receive and claim the gifts from our ancestral lineage. We open to healing and reclaim and restore our power. We harmonize and connect with the power of the healed masculine and feminine, and receive the Munay-Ki energetic transmissions to bring us into harmony and Balance with both aspects.</p> <p>Follow-up Conference Call TBA January 2016</p> <p><b>4. Remembering our Soul Journey – Winter  March 11 - 13, 2016</b></p> <p>We turn the wheel once more on The Spiral Path, moving into Winter, Honoring the North. This is the time of death, of Union with Source. In shamanic cultures, death is not an end but a transition.  Our Community supports us in this transition.</p> <p>We remember our Soul Journey beyond roles and personality. We travel beyond time and space to that which is beyond Death. We honor our ancestors who have helped us come into Being for our Soul Journey, and We remember and claim our soul’s purpose.</p> <p>We take our place as stewards of the Earth, holding her from the vantage point of space as we receive the rites of the Munay-Ki  to become an Earthkeeper.  We enter the darkness of Earth and the Void, seeds waiting to germinate, as we release what needs to die to gather energy from the transcendent Realms.</p> <p><b>Follow-up Conference Call TBA April 2016</b></p> <p><b>5. Creating a New Dream – Transcendence  May 13 - 15, 2016</b></p> <p>In the final turn of the wheel on The Spiral Path, we return to Center, coming back to things we thought we understood with Increased Knowledge, Seeing Deeper Truths. We merge with Creator energy, supported by ancient rites of the time to come, the Starkeeper and Creator initiations. Our Community becomes One Heart Radiating Light to heal ourselves and the World. </p> <p>With Love, we Create a New Dream of Transcendence, a new vision for our life and for the World. We travel outside of time to meet our Descendants who help us form the new vision for the times to come leaving behind the collective nightmare. We experience and embody Light, our template of divine perfection. We learn to use this light to take our place in service to the World.</p> <p><br/><b>&lt;a href=\"http://earthspiritway.com\"&gt;Click Here to Register </a></b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/4/0/a/600_436389226.jpeg\" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Earth Spirit Way: Walking the Spiral Path</p> <p>  A Co-Creation of Kent Dorsey, Center for Shamanic Healing and Girvani Leerer, PhD, The Shamanic Psychologist</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://earthspiritway.com/\">Walking the Spiral Path</a></b></p> <p>© Copyright 2015 All Rights Reserved Earth Spirit Way and Walking the SpiraL Path</p> <p><br/>Self Empowerment through a Shamanic Way of Life</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CenterForShamanicHealing\"> </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://earthspiritway.com/#\"> </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://earthspiritway.com/#\"> </a></p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-Oakland-Center-For-Shamanic-Healing-Ciircler/events/221368825/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":187200000,"name":"Earth Spirit Way | Walking the Spiral Path : Birthing New Beginnings","id":"221368825","time":1432926000000,"updated":1431930275000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1305340260000,"name":"Berkeley | Oakland Center For Shamanic Healing  Circle","group_lon":-122.22000122070312,"id":1856901,"urlname":"Berkeley-Oakland-Center-For-Shamanic-Healing-Ciircler","group_lat":37.84000015258789,"who":"Members of the Circle"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"headcount":0,"distance":4.295319557189941,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428121893000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Bicycle coffee does a mean coffee! and On fridays its free. 9-2pm.

Are you scared of being out of control? Do you ever let go? </p> <p>Here at OneTaste we do a practice called Orgasmic Meditation, and that practice has given us so much richness and vitality, we want to give it back to you. Practitioners have learnt so much about the nature of relating and male-female dynamics we are brimming over, and want to spread the word on our wonderful lives and the depths of what is possible.</p> <p>Can you hear the whisper of your intuition? Do you speak from your sex, and do you let the voice of your desire speak openly? Here at Turn On, this is exactly what we do and we make a practice of it. We make a practice of being real with ourselves. We have found that having your sexuality fully ramped up and living a life Powered by Orgasm is the fastest way to have everything you want. </p> <p>Come to play three communication games over the course of one hour and become part of a blossoming movement promoting authenticity in the bedroom.

We give the lunch order list to the staff by 12 noon so they can<br/>have all of our lunches ready to go at <b>12:45pm. </b>You pay for your orders individually at lunch time.</p> <p><br/>To avoid having the staff interrupt during the writing session to ask for clarification of lunch orders, <b>please remember to</b> <b>SPECIFY items</b> like (a) BEVERAGE, (b) type of BREAD for sandwich, (c) type of CHEESE for sandwich (or, \"no cheese\").</p> <p>4) When the cafe is crowded, please occupy all the seats at the tables where meetup participants are located, i.e. don't go one person per table, or we will anger the rest of the cafe customers.</p> <p>5) If you have a power strip or a few, please bring it/them! It will help us to make sure that everyone has a place to plug in.</p> <p>6) This should be obvious, but as a reminder -- the cafe is a business, not the public library. We don't want to wear out our welcome! During breaks, make sure to <b>purchase something</b> from the cafe That will cause them to want us to come back again and again.</p> <p>7) If you can't make it, please un-RSVP at least a few days in advance if at all possible.

Join us for this course preview of the oldest trail race in America.</p> <p><br/>This is the faster paced version of this workout. Participants should be able to run a 1:50 road half marathon or faster. If this doesn't sound like you, see the schedule for the easier paced version.</p> <p>This is a very difficult run -  about 14 miles round trip beginning with the 688 Dipsea steps and including 4200 ft of cumulative elevation gain. We will stop at water fountains at Muir Woods, the top of Cardiac Hill, and at Stinson beach. The longest stretch without water will be about 35 minutes - bring more if you need it. Plan on being out about 3.5 hours (including water and re-group stops).</p> <p>We'll run fairly fast on the way to Stinson Beach to simulate race conditions and then take it a little easier for the return trip. We'll take the 3 legal shortcuts on the way out (Suicide, The Swoop, and the Panoramic Shortcuts) and the \"consensus\" course for the return trip.</p> <p><a href=\"https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/315054767\">Click Here to See the Route</a>.

It derives its name from the Spanish verb embarcar, meaning \"to embark\"; embarcadero itself means \"the place to embark\". The Central Embarcadero Piers Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 20, 2002.[1]</p> <p>The Embarcadero right-of-way begins at the intersection of Second and King Streets near AT&amp;T Park, and travels north, passing under the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge. The Embarcadero continues north past the Ferry Building at Market Street, Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, before ending at Pier 45. A section of The Embarcadero which ran between Folsom Street and Drumm Street was formerly known as East Street. The sidewalk along the waterfront between Harrison Street and Broadway was named \"Herb Caen Way...\" after the death of celebrated local columnist Herb Caen in 1997. The three dots, or ellipsis, deliberately are included in honor of columnist Herb Caen's Pulitzer Prize winning writing style.\"</p> <p><b>What is Social Landscape Photography?</b></p> <p><br/>Social Landscape Photography, or street photography is focused on how people in a community associate to their environment, area, or scene. Great street photography not only tells you a story but also connects you to the scene. Social Landscape photography is one of most important genre of photography because it documents change and progress. Join me as we explore and deconstruct the work of famed San Francisco Photographer Fred Lyons. “Photographer Fred Lyon has been called \"San Francisco's Brassai\". He's also been compared to Cartier Bresson, Atget and Andre Kertez, but all with a San Francisco twist.”</p> <p><b>We will meet at One Market in  San Francisco</b></p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/keithbdixonmeetup/events/222062397/","yes_rsvp_count":7,"duration":5400000,"name":"50mm of the Embarcadero","id":"222062397","time":1433084400000,"updated":1431970119000,"group":{"join_mode":"approval","created":1302822221000,"name":"The Keith B Dixon Meetup","group_lon":-122.05999755859375,"id":1815335,"urlname":"keithbdixonmeetup","group_lat":37.630001068115234,"who":"Members"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94706","country":"us","city":"Albany","address_1":"1226 Solano Ave.","name":"Suzette Crepe Cafe","lon":-122.29512,"id":11271352,"state":"CA","lat":37.890461,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":1.972757339477539,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1361745798000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>A fun group meets Sundays at 8 AM in Albany, at the Suzette Crepe Cafe, 1226 Solano (above Talbot).

We project a big 30 foot wide image on the side of the Old Hamilton Theater building (closed for many years now) and transmit the audio over the FM band (88.3FM) just like modern drive-ins. We operate totally via donations and even have a small concession snack bar at each performance, in addition to raffle prizes and special presentations during the intro and intermission segments!! COME JOIN US and KEEP THE DRIVE-IN ALIVE!</p> <p><b>Drive-In Tips:</b><br/>Arrive Early if you plan to park and watch from your car! There's lots of space for chairs and blankets in front, and we encourage everyone to try it if you haven't, yet. The Pre-Show runs 15-20 minutes (the movie does not start exactly at the time listed but please don't arrive late or you may not get a parking spot in the main lot). There will be a 20 minute intermission and raffle.  NOTE: THERE ARE NO REGULAR RESTROOMS AT THIS LOCATION - there's the restaurant across the road, a park on Hamilton Pkwy around the corner with facilities through twilight and sometimes the church across the street has an event and we can use theirs (located in the courtyard) but otherwise we have to improvise!</p> <p><b>Drive-In Etiquette:</b><br/>CAR HEADLIGHTS AND PARKING LIGHTS OFF during the show. <b>LARGER VEHICLES PLEASE PARK IN THE BACK ROW (Minivans, SUVs, Crossovers, Pickups).</b> We can't always be 100% on top of this so, if you have a smaller car, do try to come early to get a FRONT row spot! And during the movie, please keep talking low volume so as not to disturb your neighbors. We also ask folks to refrain from smoking near other attendees. We encourage everyone to enjoy the summer evening and sit outside so we have some boom boxes for audio but we can't guarantee you will have the best listening experience by sitting out of your car unless you bring your own radio and/or portable with headphones. <b>ALL CARS MUST DRIVE SLOWLY</b> when in the parking area. Children are welcome, but need to be supervised at all times. Dogs are welcome but need to be leashed at all times. Access to parking lot usually closes after the movie starts, at which point we ask folks park in the adjacent lot and walk in with lawn chair/blanket so as not to disturb those watching the movie. Please do not drive in to the lot after the movie has started.</p> <p><b>Snack Bar &amp; Raffles:</b><br/>DONATE for SNACKS at our Concession Stand equipped with popcorn, hot dogs, candy and refreshments! There's usually themed cupcakes and/or other treats plus A RAFFLE with awesome prizes!! Raffles are held during intermission and usually feature a movie-themed prize-pack!... Small bills greatly appreciated!</p> <p><b>PLEASE DON'T LITTER -- TAKE ALL TRASH WITH YOU OR DEPOSIT IT WITH US AT THE CONCESSION STAND!</b></p> <p><b>Advertising:</b><br/>ADVERTISING is available during our pre-show.

Her songs are influenced by listening to Alan Lomax's field recordings from the South, and growing up listening to her uncles' Filipino folk guitar playing. She has played with a mixed genre of San Francisco bay area bands over the past years that have also influenced her music, from latin/african rhythms, folk, bluegrass pickings and inspirations from gospel music - a mix of stompin', swayin', and timeless Americana. Her music is reminiscent of front porch storytelling, of ghosts and the living, times of laughter and tears.</p> <p>Her latest album, Put Back Charlie, was released in the Summer 2014, and tours solo and as well as with her band as Aireene &amp; The Rarities. \"This is our jaw dropping act of the season...she gathered some of the best musicians in town around her...She has taken off like a rocket ship and everyone is suddenly in love with the music and show of Aireene Espiritu...You might like to say, \"Remember When\" a short way up the musical road.\" - Bob Stane, The Coffee Gallery Backstage</p> <p>“Espiritu’s penchant for songs that sound like they came off a 78 rpm record, listeners will be swept away.” - Good Times Weekly, Santa Cruz CA</p> <p>\"I love what I heard, It's perfect for my kinda folk show-- bright, melodic,rootsy and with excellent vocals and hot pickin' too.

They called themselves<br/>KARMINA \"song\" in Latin and wrote melodies inspired<br/>by soulful creators from Brahms to Bjork to The Beatles.</p> <p><br/>Since then, KARMINA's imaginative arrangements and rich<br/>vocal harmonies have appeared on major television shows<br/>including Pretty Little Liars, Shameless, Ravenswood,<br/>CSI: NY, Switched At Birth, and How I Met Your Mother<br/>among others. They've written, sung, produced and performed  a vast catalogue of original music; toured the US, UK and Europe; and opened for Sheryl Crow, Sara Bareilles, Carol King, Train and, most recently, John Legend at the Los<br/>Angeles Nokia Theater.</p> <p><br/>After back to back summer tours of France and Israel, Karmina is full-speed-ahead back in the studio breaking ground with a new record that features the orchestral arranging of storied, award-winning composer John Powell (How to Train Your Dragon, The Bourne Identity). </p> <p><br/>Critics have described their new cinematic indie-pop sound<br/>as \"a cross between Florence Welch and Mumford and Sons\"<br/>replete with vivid imagery and enthralling storytelling.<br/>Their new release, Queens of Heart, pays homage to powerful  women who have made an impact, much like KARMINA  strives to do in 2015.</p> <p><br/>Opening this show will be McHugh &amp; Devine<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCebXEGpQgY\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCebXEGpQgY\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCebXEGpQgY</a></a></p> <p><br/>Doors open at 7PM Music at 8PM Cheers!

The Balboa Cafe in SF is relatively similar.  It attracts an older and unique crowd that is known for their strong personalities and creative pickup lines.  Balboa Cafe is also a local favorite serving up the classics, including the famous Balboa Burger that sits on many lists as one of the best burgers in San Francisco.</p> <p><a href=\"http://eswsf.com/\"><b>Eastside West</b></a> - Eastside West is a very 'Marina' gastro-pub located on one of the most popular corners in the Marina.  With Balboa Cafe, Matrix, KT's and City Tavern within a block you always get an interested crowd here.  They also have a DJ and do fun events on a regular basis.  During the day it's a fun bar that \"<i>serves simple but bold dishes that are local and organic wherever possible, in a lively, social setting.</i>\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/kts-fillmore-san-francisco\"><b>KT's</b> </a>- KT's has a reputation for being 'blackout central' but can be a really fun spot to dance and hangout.  It's your typical bar-turned-club on the weekends.  There biggest problem is the ongoing issue of stolen phones.  Ladies, keep your bags closed! I've had a friend get her phone snatched right out of her bag.  It happens often here.  Overall you'll find a very 'Marina' based demographic here trying to get over a long week.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.matrixfillmore.com/\">Matrix</a> </b>- Martix is a pretty fun lounge located alongside Eastside West and right across from Balboa Cafe, City Tavern, and Pizza Orgasmica.  I've seen this lounge slammed as well as empty on just about any given night. They have a long bar, fun dancing, a lounge atmosphere, and some aggressive bartenders.  If the DJ is on it's a fun spot to stop and dance for awhile.</p> <p><a href=\"http://stockintradesf.com/\"><b>Stock In Trade</b></a> -  Stock In Trade is a fun bar that features a fun attractive crowd.  The Marina community is strong here and they feature an indoor bocce ball court.  Located right on Lombard st there is always people wandering around and typically a bacon-hotdog stand within sight.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tacko.co/\"><b>Tacko</b></a> - Tacko isn't really much of a bar but rather a taqueria worth mention.  They have a few beers for purchase but are know for their 'Nick Style' tacos and awesome Taco Tuesday specials.  I highly recommend checking it out sometime with friends.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hi-fi-lounge-san-francisco\">HiFi</a> </b>- HiFi is a fun hip bar that really gets your senses going.  With different colors and good lighting you're always bound to leave in a good mood.  The crowd here is slightly different from your typical Marina crowd and somehow they've managed to stay off most radars.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lightningtavernsf.com/\"><b>Lightning Tavern</b></a> - Lightning Tavern is your basic bar with an awesome twist.  While this isn't where you're going to stop to watch the big game, Lightning has two different times in the day when they randomly declare 'lightning round' and the bartender rings a bell.  This means that for the next 10 minutes your drinks are $1.  Last time I was there we were able to stock up on three drinks a piece before the end of the round.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brickyardsf.com/\"><b>The Brick Yard</b></a> - The Brick Yard is possibly one of my favorite spots to watch a warriors game.  Let alone the fact that it is right next to Rome (one of my favorite burger joints), it also has a long bar, some comfortable booth seating, and plenty of TVs to catch the game on.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bus-stop-san-francisco\">Bus Stop</a> </b>- The Bus Stop is yet another divey and fun bar in the Marina.  There is a pool table in the back, some seating near the bar, and they have trivia night a few nights out of the week.  It's the type of bar where everyone knows the bartender and visits regularly.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.thebluelightsf.com/\">The Blue Light</a> </b>- Blue Light has one of the longest bars in the Marina and is a fun after work spot to grab a drink </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sabrosasf.com/\"><b>Sabrosa</b></a> - What used to be City Tavern has now turned into Sabrosa which is a fun and fancy tequila bar located right on the corner by Eastside West and Babloa Cafe. The restaurant bar is an ideal date spot and has a well lit dining room and a trendy feel to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.republicsf.com/\"><b>The Bear Republic</b></a> - The Republic as it's called in SF is actually a branch of The Bear Republic Brewery.  This is a relatively new bar but has caught on fast as a local favorite.  Featuring a variety of CA and other micro brews for a mere $5 a beer this bar is a hot destination for beer consumers.  </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.silvercloudssf.com/\"><b>Silver Cloud</b></a> - This is actually where I watch the superbowl two years ago.  It's a fun bar that hosts some pretty entertaining karaoke nights.  They also have an occasional live band and one huuuge TV near the bar for sports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetipsypigsf.com/\"><b>Tipsy Pig</b></a> - Tipsy Pig is my #1 stop on a Sunday morning after a long weekend.  It's a fun little bar that provides good sports and amazing bloody marys.  They also have a good food selection to recover from any kind of damage you caused yourself the night before.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-none-san-francisco\"><b>Bar None</b></a> - Known for it's distinct 'stuck in college' crowd, Bar None has a very divey feel to it and features beer pong tables, sticky floors, and plenty of random games to keep anyone occupied for hours.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cellardoor-sf.com/\"><b>The Cellar Door</b></a> - \"<i>An intimate Wine bar and lounge, offering a variety of global wine and specialty beer, as well as delicious small plates of food.

Balboa Cafe is also a local favorite serving up the classics, including the famous Balboa Burger that sits on many lists as one of the best burgers in San Francisco.</p> <p><a href=\"http://eswsf.com/\">Eastside West</a> - Eastside West is a very 'Marina' gastro-pub located on one of the most popular corners in the Marina.  With Balboa Cafe, Matrix, KT's and City Tavern within a block you always get an interested crowd here.  They also have a DJ and do fun events on a regular basis.  During the day it's a fun bar that \"<i>serves simple but bold dishes that are local and organic wherever possible, in a lively, social setting.</i>\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/kts-fillmore-san-francisco\">KT's </a>- KT's has a reputation for being 'blackout central' but can be a really fun spot to dance and hangout.  It's your typical bar-turned-club on the weekends.  There biggest problem is the ongoing issue of stolen phones.  Ladies, keep your bags closed! I've had a friend get her phone snatched right out of her bag.  It happens often here.  Overall you'll find a very 'Marina' based demographic here trying to get over a long week.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.matrixfillmore.com/\">Matrix</a> - Martix is a pretty fun lounge located alongside Eastside West and right across from Balboa Cafe, City Tavern, and Pizza Orgasmica.  I've seen this lounge slammed as well as empty on just about any given night. They have a long bar, fun dancing, a lounge atmosphere, and some aggressive bartenders.  If the DJ is on it's a fun spot to stop and dance for awhile.</p> <p><a href=\"http://stockintradesf.com/\">Stock In Trade</a> -  Stock In Trade is a fun bar that features a fun attractive crowd.  The Marina community is strong here and they feature an indoor bocce ball court.  Located right on Lombard st there is always people wandering around and typically a bacon-hotdog stand within sight.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tacko.co/\">Tacko</a> - Tacko isn't really much of a bar but rather a taqueria worth mention.  They have a few beers for purchase but are know for their 'Nick Style' tacos and awesome Taco Tuesday specials.  I highly recommend checking it out sometime with friends.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hi-fi-lounge-san-francisco\">HiFi</a> - HiFi is a fun hip bar that really gets your senses going.  With different colors and good lighting you're always bound to leave in a good mood.  The crowd here is slightly different from your typical Marina crowd and somehow they've managed to stay off most radars.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lightningtavernsf.com/\">Lightning Tavern</a> - Lightning Tavern is your basic bar with an awesome twist.  While this isn't where you're going to stop to watch the big game, Lightning has two different times in the day when they randomly declare 'lightning round' and the bartender rings a bell.  This means that for the next 10 minutes your drinks are $1.  Last time I was there we were able to stock up on three drinks a piece before the end of the round.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brickyardsf.com/\">The Brick Yard</a> - The Brick Yard is possibly one of my favorite spots to watch a warriors game.  Let alone the fact that it is right next to Rome (one of my favorite burger joints), it also has a long bar, some comfortable booth seating, and plenty of TVs to catch the game on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bus-stop-san-francisco\">Bus Stop</a> - The Bus Stop is yet another divey and fun bar in the Marina.  There is a pool table in the back, some seating near the bar, and they have trivia night a few nights out of the week.  It's the type of bar where everyone knows the bartender and visits regularly.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebluelightsf.com/\">The Blue Light</a> - Blue Light has one of the longest bars in the Marina and is a fun after work spot to grab a drink </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sabrosasf.com/\">Sabrosa</a> - What used to be City Tavern has now turned into Sabrosa which is a fun and fancy tequila bar located right on the corner by Eastside West and Babloa Cafe. The restaurant bar is an ideal date spot and has a well lit dining room and a trendy feel to it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.republicsf.com/\">The Bear Republic</a> - The Republic as it's called in SF is actually a branch of The Bear Republic Brewery.  This is a relatively new bar but has caught on fast as a local favorite.  Featuring a variety of CA and other micro brews for a mere $5 a beer this bar is a hot destination for beer consumers.  </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.silvercloudssf.com/\">Silver Cloud</a> - This is actually where I watch the superbowl two years ago.  It's a fun bar that hosts some pretty entertaining karaoke nights.  They also have an occasional live band and one huuuge TV near the bar for sports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetipsypigsf.com/\">Tipsy Pig</a> - Tipsy Pig is my #1 stop on a Sunday morning after a long weekend.  It's a fun little bar that provides good sports and amazing bloody marys.  They also have a good food selection to recover from any kind of damage you caused yourself the night before.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-none-san-francisco\">Bar None</a> - Known for it's distinct 'stuck in college' crowd, Bar None has a very divey feel to it and features beer pong tables, sticky floors, and plenty of random games to keep anyone occupied for hours.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cellardoor-sf.com/\">The Cellar Door</a> - \"<i>An intimate Wine bar and lounge, offering a variety of global wine and specialty beer, as well as delicious small plates of food. Formerly Pe Yale, Cellar Door was constructed using reclaimed materials to give it a unique vibe that appeals to all crowds. whether you’re looking to cozy up to a date or meet friends out for a good night, Cellar Door is the place for you.</i>\"</p> <p>If you have any questions or concerns please contact me on Facebook <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/arthur.g.bahr\">HERE</a>.</p> <p>I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again soon!</p> <p>Arthur G.

Wilson has said that the earth is a little-known planet. We hardly know anything about our own home. With this in mind, we need to plug in and charge up our sense of wonder. Wondering and wandering naturalists like John Muir and John Burroughs liked to mingle the words Beauty, Nature, and God. Almost Pantheists, these naturalistic writers could best be described as Pan-Naturists. For them, life itself is a living web—a vibrant wilderness classroom open for exploration. They had little time for the distractions of an imagined super-Nature.</p> <p>Former Presbyterian Minister, Interfaith Chaplain, author, and educator Chris Highland will take us on a “hike of ideas and images” based on his writings and his College of Marin course, 'A Wild Spirituality of Nature.'

Let me know if you have any questions!</p> <p>Exercise One: Peer introduction.</p> <p>Instead of having you introduce yourself to the group. We will have you introduce yourself to a randomly assigned buddy. Then this buddy will be responsible for introducing you to the group as a new friend. You will be responsible for introducing your buddy to the group as well. I think this exercise will give us a bit different perspective in hearing about our life told through a third person. I think the problem with self-introduction is that you will be stressed or pre-occupied to introduce yourself and you may have forgotten to listen to other people and that might defeat the purpose of self-introduction.</p> <p>Exercise Two: Something to Bring</p> <p>For this exercise, bring something you enjoy or that is important to you. It could be a photo, a book, a song, an app, a poem, a little story or an encounter. Be creative. Something that says something about you. Something that is interesting to you, or that you enjoy or that is important to you. If you are a guitarist or knows a portal instrument, you are welcome to bring a piece!</p> <p>Exercise Three: Personal Goals</p> <p>We will have every member to write down a specific personal goal they have for themselves on a piece of paper without identifying yourself. You will fold it up and put it in a box. I will then read these goals to the group and let the group share their thoughts and related experience on these goals. The goal of this exercise is to find what is in common among us despite all the differences we have with one another. I think at the end of the day, friendships is about understanding what is important to our friends and help one another reach our goals and be mutually supportive.</p> <p>Afterwards, I will encourage members to maybe make dinner plans with one another if there is a connection.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/authentic-dating/events/222641625/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":7200000,"name":"Authentic Speed Friending","id":"222641625","time":1433026800000,"updated":1432058008000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1431474179000,"name":"Authentic Cultural Dating","group_lon":-122.4000015258789,"id":18593645,"urlname":"authentic-dating","group_lat":37.790000915527344,"who":"authentic lovers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Pinole","address_1":"2644 Appaloosa Trl","name":"Hannah's Place","lon":-122.266586,"id":23759029,"state":"CA","lat":37.98716,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.113749504089355,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1424126873000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Note that this book was originally going to be discussed in March but that discussion had to be rescheduled -- if you read it for the March discussion, we would still love to hear what you think! </b></p> <p><br/>In the near future, a meningitis-like disease has swept through the world population, leaving 1% of its victims \"locked in\" in their own bodies, unable to speak or interact with the outside world.

Susan</p> <p>\n\n\nHi everyone!!</p> <p>This month we're meeting in Berkeley close to Lake Anza.  As always, it's a potluck so please bring food to grill and share, and/or drinks to share.  You can also bring a swimsuit if you'd like to take a dip in the lake.  The water is cold but refreshing!</p> <p><br/>Once you enter Tilden Park, follow Lake Anza Road and park on the gravel parking lot that comes before the asphalt parking lot that's closes to the lake.  At the end of the GRAVEL parking lot you'll see the sign \"Spillway Picnic Site\", go down the stairs and we're right there.  Hope to see you there!

The purpose of a shuttle walk is to prevent having to walk back to our cars along the exact same path we came.  It's useful in a situation where walking a loop isn't feasible.  At the meeting point at Craneway we'll pile into as few cars as are needed to carry us all and we'll drive to the Pt. Isabel Regional Shoreline parking lot a few miles away.  From there we will leave the cars and walk to the Craneway Pavilion (a.k.a. Ford Assembly Plant) along the paved shoreline path.  Then we'll huddle at Botto Bistro after the walk (optional but encouraged, see below).  Lastly, we'll need to shuttle folks back to Pt. Isabel to get their cars.  It's simpler than it sounds, and the drive time from Craneway to Pt. Isabel is only 5-10 minutes.  To do the shuttle will of course require some volunteers to shuttle folks a short distance in their cars.  If we don't have enough volunteer drivers we'll simply drop the shuttle idea and walk half as far as we had planned, then retrace our steps to the Craneway parking lot.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/a/6/4/600_400390852.jpeg\" /></p> <p>DIRECTIONS: We'll meet at the Craneway Pavilion's free west parking lot (i.e. NOT the one you have to enter via a security guard checkpoint).  From Hwy. 580 westbound take the Harbour Way South exit.  Stay right after exiting, then at the stoplight turn right onto Cutting Blvd.  Go a half block then turn right at the first stoplight onto Harbour Way.  Go straight for 1.0 miles until the street dead ends at the Craneway Pavilion parking lot west of the building. </p> <p>(In the marsh section of our walk keep an eye out for the California clapper rail, an endangered species.)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/4/0/600_437365408.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Common-sense dog rules should suffice, but look out for signs along the trail:  Dogs should be well behaved and under voice control at all times.  Dog walkers are required to clean up after their dogs and remove dog waste bags from the trails.

Some of the things developing this capacity has brought me are - confidence in my own inner guidance, greater trust in life (especially when it comes to curve balls!), certainty in following my heart, and making decisions with much greater ease.</p> <p>In this intro session, we'll talk about how intuition works, what gets in the way, ways it can serve us. And then we will jump into various ways to access it using our 4 different psychic channels (clairvoyance, clairaudience, claircognizance and clairsentience.) I believe everyone already has these capacities -it's just a matter of recognizing it and learning how to use it effectively. We each have some inherent preferences, which is why I cover all of them, in all classes.</p> <p>I wish I could tell you we can develop the capacity to hear /see/ feel clearly in a day! Perhaps some of us can and do -- but most of us need practice! This is the reason for ongoing classes (every two weeks.) So come and see if this class feels right for you.</p> <p>A little more about the ongoing classes:</p> <p>They are completely experiential and will give you a broad range of tools to experiment with. You will have lots of time to practice both accessing your intuition and discovering what might be in the way of you hearing your inner voice more clearly.</p> <p>Generally, each meetup is 2 hours:</p> <p>• We start with a meditation to arrive, ground, center and get quiet.</p> <p>• We do introductions and check in as to how things are going</p> <p>• After meditation and intros, we spend the rest of the first time reviewing and playing with various tools, using real life questions, and gaining more ease in hearing our own wisdom.</p> <p>• Although there can be painful moments of hearing something we would rather not have heard, mostly these tools are very validating.</p> <p>• We have fun!

Come do what 99% of San Francisco residents never do… hop aboard a boat and ride out under the Golden Gate Bridge to visit one of the richest marine ecosystems in the world. The Farallon Islands, just 27 miles off the coast of San Francisco, lie amid the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, a food-rich marine ecosystem that attracts whales, dolphins, seals and seabirds each summer and fall, to feed and to breed. Researchers have catalogued hundreds of individual humpbacks and blue whales as seasonal feeding residents. Twenty three species of marine mammals, including eighteen species of whales and dolphins, can be found here. The Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is the largest seabird rookery in the contiguous United States with nesting Tufted Puffins, Pigeon Guillemots, Rhinoceros Auklets, Common Murres and other species. Migratory seabirds such as Shearwaters, Jaegers, and Phalaropes are also attracted by these nutrient-rich waters. Island beaches are covered with sea lions, including massive Steller's sea lions, now on the Endangered Species List.</p> <p>We will start out on Saturday with a presentation about the National Marine Sanctuary and then follow it up with a photography how to presentation giving you an introduction to your DSLR. You will learn some useful tips that will allow you to keep your head up with your eyes on the horizon and in search of whales.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/EcoSee/events/220929445/","yes_rsvp_count":9,"name":"Whales, Birds & Life of the Farallon Islands","id":"220929445","time":1433016000000,"updated":1432541162000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1313116258000,"name":"EcoSee Adventures","group_lon":-122.45999908447266,"id":2329111,"urlname":"EcoSee","group_lat":37.779998779296875,"who":"Wild Adventurers"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"Conservatory Dr West","name":"Bunny Meadow Golden Gate Park","lon":-122.462021,"id":19735962,"state":"CA","lat":37.77187,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":12.507711410522461,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1430194850000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>We're back at the Bunny Meadow!

So only RSVP if you think you really are going to show up, please.</p> <p>We will meet at the small parking lot here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.9081859,-122.5759341,76m/data=!3m1!1e3\"><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@37.9081859,-122.5759341,76m/data=!3m1!1e3\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/maps/@37.9081859,-122.5759341,76m/data=!3m1!1e3</a></a></p> <p><br/>DON'T USE THE MEETUP MAP.  USE THE LINK ABOVE.</p> <p>This is a small parking lot, but there is a large one further west on the Panorama Highway.  There is also parking along the side of the road on Panorama.</p> <p>Once we are ready, we will walk to the trail head with is a short distance from the parking lot.  We'll take the Panorama Trail to the Ocean View Trail to the Lost Trail to the Fern Creek Trail, taking our break at the Alice Eastwood group campsite.  Then after break, we'll go back the Fern Creek Trail, past the Lost Trail, taking Fern Creek all the way back to the Main Muir Woods Trail.  We'll take that back toward the entrance and then take the Ocean View Trail back up the Panorama Trail to the trailhead at the Panorama Hwy.  The whole loop is approximately 5 miles.  There aren't too many steep places going up, though the steps down on the Lost trail are a bit steep.</p> <p>We will cancel for rain the morning of if necessary. </p> <p>We'll likely take the full time allotted, but we may get back by 4 p.m., depending on the hike goes. If it is imperative that you be back at your car before 4:30, please plan to depart from the group early or consider another hike. </p> <p>Look forward to seeing you guys there! </p> <p>**PLEASE NOTE*** We/I have no idea if cells or GPS will work here, so please take the time to get directions (both what I wrote above and using \"get directions\" from google) and milage markers BEFORE you leave so that you can meet us at the designated place and time. Using google maps or GPS while on route results in some wonky, incorrect directions due to the sketchy reception for such devices in these remote areas. So again, it is best to get directions BEFORE you leave, at a place that has good internet access (such as a computer). We'll wait 10 to 15 minutes for everyone and then will begin the hike. Let me know if you have any questions.</p> <p>See you then!</p>","how_to_find_us":"Group of guys in the parking lot","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Gay-Mens-Hiking-Meditation-Group/events/222410271/","yes_rsvp_count":20,"duration":14400000,"name":"Muir Woods Hiking Meditation","id":"222410271","time":1433014200000,"updated":1432771747000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1377970677000,"name":"Gay Men's Hiking Meditation","group_lon":-122.44000244140625,"id":10049922,"urlname":"Bay-Area-Gay-Mens-Hiking-Meditation-Group","group_lat":37.77000045776367,"who":"Hiking Meditaters"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"zip":"94107","country":"us","city":"San Francisco","phone":"415-974-1115","address_1":"800 Embarcadero St.","name":"South Beach Cafe","lon":-122.38841,"id":953857,"state":"CA","lat":37.782406,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":8.871580123901367,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432617875000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>Copa del Rey Final!<br/>Hola Culers!

Smell the salty air! See an exotic sculpture titled \"Rising Wave\"! Share a bright summer morning with your fellow adventure walkers, gabbing excitedly on a new walking trail that's mostly paved, but with a special twist at the end.  There's a turn onto a wide dirt road that leads through wild grasses to the top of a high hill.  See a breath-taking panorama with interesting views down in every direction.  (The trees of San Leandro!  The Oakland Hills...)</p> <p>There's wildlife everywhere in this close-to-home habitat, and a landscape that's occasionally surreal.  (Lizards! Rabbits...!)  Birds soar over its vast sunny fields, and there's even a quiet cove shimmering near the end of the trail.  Dogs are okay -- even off-leash -- and there's a nice park (with a public restroom).  We'll walk up a couple hills, but I'm really excited about this trail, which probably comes out to around four miles, so we'll be finished in an hour.  </p> <p>Which will bring us to lunchtime, and a chance to share a wonderful new Bay Area dining experience!  Just down the road are two fine restaurants -- <i>Horatio's</i> and <i>El Torito</i>.  <i>Horatio's</i> promises \"the romance and brilliance of the Royal Navy of some 200 years ago,\" with hand-crafted beams and authentic nautical trinkets (along with <a href=\"http://horatios.com/menu.php?id=Lunch%20Menu\">a classy menu</a> that offers wild mushroom ravioli or steak and crab sliders...)  Closer to the bay is San Leandro's own <i>El Torito</i>, which has some fantastic views of the bay and a menu which claims they were among the first to popularize the Margarita within the United States).</p> <p>I've scoped out this trail, and it's one I've been waiting for just the right weekend weather.  So I hope you'll come and share our special Saturday morning adventure.    Just remember:</p> <p><i>        Exercise! Socialize! Scenery!

Clear your mind instead of filling it. … To improvise, it is essential that we use the present moment efficiently. An instant of distraction — searching for a witty line, for example — robs us of our investment in what is actually happening. We need to know everything about *this* moment. Instead of preparing an outcome, ready yourself for whatever may come. Open your eyes, breathe fully, and attend to just this moment. Make it your world. Allow planning or thinking-ahead thoughts to pass through if they occur. If your mind gets absorbed in these thoughts … redirect your attention to a detail in the immediate environment. … Substitute attention for preparation.” — Patricia Madsen</p> <p>“If you have the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment.

It was his directorial debut--a masterpiece--and although he never directed another, Pan is so exquisitely rendered and psychologically astute it has secured Schwenzen's reputation in cinema history. Schwenzen wrote in the film’s original program, 'The task we have given ourselves is to make a beautiful and artistic pictorialization of Hamsun’s strangest story. Outwardly, there is no strong plot in <i>Pan </i>which could possibly tempt us, but the book is, with its powerful beauty and lyricism, so rich in atmosphere, so characteristic and strong in its human descriptions, that it offers both the director and the actors a very special artistic task. If we have succeeded, through our images, together with excerpts of Hamsun's text, to give life to these people and this atmosphere, as in the book, then we have fulfilled the great task we set for ourselves.'\"</p> <p>Live musical accompaniment by <a href=\"http://www.silentfilm.org/festival/music-musicians/guenter-buchwald\">Guenter Buchwald</a></p> <p>Introduced by Bent Kvalvik of the National Library of Norway.</p> <p>More information: <a href=\"http://www.thecastrotheatre.com/\">www.thecastrotheatre.com</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.silentfilm.org/\">www.silentfilm.org</a></p> <p>8:45 Meet at the Castro Theatre (429 Castro St. at Market) to purchase tickets, then walk around the corner to Starbucks [masked]th St.) for coffee and conversation. </p> <p>9:15 Return to the Castro Theatre to take our seats.

Let me know if you are interested in being a client or a participant.</p> <p><b>Please come a little early!</b> It helps our process immensely when we can start on time, and not have interruptions in the constellations as people arrive.</p> <p><b>Cost:</b> Only $5.00 for participants.</p> <p><b>Parking:</b> There is ample parking around Rudramandir, particularly WEST of 6th Street. However, out of respect for the residential neighbors, they ask that guests follow these guidelines:</p> <p>Park directly in front of the building or on 6th Street between Bancroft Way and Addison (the block north of our building, towards University).</p> <p>Park on Bancroft Way, between 6th and 4th Streets (west of 6th).</p> <p>Park on 5th and 4th Streets between Channing and Addison.</p> <p>PLEASE DO NOT PARK EAST OF 6TH STREET.

MYNARSKI DEATH PLUMMET<br/>Dir: Matthew Rankin | Canada 2014 | 8min. | Animation / Visual<br/>The story of Winnipeg WWII hero Andrew Mynarski is related stunningly in this explosive, expressionistic and psychedelic envisioning of his final moments, paying homage to our collective past while transforming fact into brilliant celluloid fantasia.</p> <p>3.

Single, doubles or all skills levels are welcome. I am organising this group because I realize that more and more people are falling in love with this game in Califonia. I am new to this country and Bay Area. I hope to meet new friends to enjoy this game together and make a healthier body through doing this sport.

Check the forum where the group is if you cannot find us.  </p> <p>About Diversity</p> <p>As the Fri group is expanding, I would like to re-clarify the idea of \"diversity\" in a more detailed way, because I think we have enough capacity (10+people) to be able to accommodate people from all different sorts of badminton levels and social cultural backgrounds and make sure every single one is having fun. So, I would encourage people to use your best emotional intelligence and judgement to find time to play with the people who has a lower level than you for whatever period of time that is available to you. Say, if you think you are an advanced/intermediate level player, please spend some time with intermediate/ beginning level players 1) intentionally reach out or 2)whenever you want to take a break from finishing some exhausting games, or 3) you notice beginner players (they have fewer resources ) are \"lonely\". Whatever ways you feel resonate with. But, (Important!) you do not have to sacrifice your own play rhythm and time for taking care of others. </p> <p>This is probably not within your comfort zone and it might not be able to maximize the enjoyment of getting the competitiveness of the game. However, I would invite members to challenge themselves a little bit and find different ways of enjoying badminton through playing with various people. If you have difficulties to make that happen, or you do not feel comfortable with that idea, that is also understandable and worth being well respected. I want to honor that diversity piece too. We do not judge people on that too.  ☺☺</p>","how_to_find_us":"Will announce the court number on forum.

Healers and sensitives of all kinds have benefited from working with chriss, affecting their lives in every dimension, from personal to professional and emotional and spiritual.</p> <p>In my first visit it was clear to me that Chriss was an angel, a soul I had manifested to be an ally in my life journey. I signed up for 3 months worth of sessions and little did I know how transformational they would be. In the 12 weeks I gained so much knowledge about myself, my patterns, health, culture, communication, and how to listen to my spirit and intuition. I went through a lot of unlearning and relearning, unloading and nourishing, thanks to his gentle yet empowering guidance, meditation, and shamanic medicine and energy work. He has such a strong desire for others to reach their optimum health mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually. He has vast amounts of information that he is always happy to share. I have gained so much from working with him and will never be able to go back to the defeated person I used to be.\"</p> <p>\"From the start, you saw right through. I couldn't get away with anything with you. Every type of healer I had been to over the past 2 decades were nothing compared to you, your work and what You helped me do with my life. Thank you immensely.\"</p> <p>“You are the amazing one – a true healer, a grand spirit who has helped me to see the TRUE nature of my spirit and in doing so, you set me free.”</p> <p>\"Working with Chriss is like having an exceptionally skilled and capable mirror in my life advocating for me. I felt held in compassion and safe within to share myself because of the safe space he held for me to be heard. Experiencing his energy medicine was like the sensation of being enveloped back inside the womb and I felt I could see, feel and experience being in an experience of Divine Love. He is the most powerful mirror I have had of what true unconditional love really is and through him, I learned to really love and respect myself and hold compassion for who I am, instead of living in shame, regret and judgment of myself. I am able to really understand and know myself and frame my “story” in a light of the beautiful being that I AM because Chriss helped me to realize and live my truth. Chriss is a true healer, compassionate heart, and friend on my journey through life.”</p> <p>“Chriss’s presence in my healing has helped me to regenerate renewal and energy into my life. In the physical realm, I have experienced a dramatic decrease in inflammation, pain and sluggish metabolism/ energy through Chriss’s Reiki healing. Spiritually, his counseling has opened up a true “awakening” in me and this awakening has given birth to a lifelong commitment to a right and true relationship with the universe. The space that Chriss creates for his clients is a safe haven in which to open up in. Because of this, I have been able to work through past hurts, patterns of behavior, and reignite a deep compassion for myself and others. Through deep listening and fruitful counseling methods, he has helped me to be an active participant in my healing process. Being in the presence of such a spirit as Chriss has helped me to begin the process of freeing my mind from years of self-judgment, guilt and shame. The benefits of this practice have revealed so many new possibilities in my life. His gentle soul serves as a “mirror” to mine and this mirroring has helped to facilitate deep self realization, opening of awareness, and connection to my source. In my experience, his healing abilities have gone beyond what we normally look to in therapy or energy healing and transcended into a very effective transformative healing of my mind, body and spirit.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Call for an easy low key conversation today to meet and talk about our lives.</p> <p>Warmly,</p> <p>Chriss</p> <p><br/>[masked]<br/>website: wholebeinghealing.com<br/>[masked]</p> <p>other client comments:</p> <p>\"In 20 years in this business, I've never seen anything like it!\"<br/>\"I'm in total bliss.

These, among many others, are nicknames for the North. It attracts adventurers and settlers. Adventurers delve into the cavernous wreckage of dwarven and drow strongholds and explore mysterious ruins of ancient cultures, while settlers look for new and untamed lands - untrampled by human footsteps - to eke out an existence unfettered by laws, taxes, and the prying eyes and gossipy mouths of nosy neighbors.</p> <p>Our story begins with a delegation from the dwarven city of Mirabar bound for Waterdeep, the City of Splendors, mysteriously disappearing in a valley deep in the Savage Frontier. Among the missing: a renowned dwarven historian and his collection of ancient manuscripts; three diplomats, each carrying a coded document; important spell components for the creation of a powerful and magical grove; and lastly, a body of a fallen knight to be interred with honor with the Knights of Samular.</p> <p>Three heroes have arrived to tackle the mystery:</p> <p>Enna: the half-elven ranger who long ago woke up in a forest with amnesia, starving and bruised. With her panther as her pet companion, she was raised by her elven and half-elven parents. Her only clue to her past: a strange map of a long-forgotten dwarven stronghold beneath the Sumber Hills.</p> <p>Liam Wolfheart: cleric of Chauntea and merchant of the Wolfheart Shipping &amp; Brewing Co. of Neverwinter. His father’s ship fell under attack on the Trackless Sea by the nefarious Gar Shatterkeel. With most of his crew lost, Liam and his ally Cirdon have tracked Shatterkeel to a frontier valley north of Waterdeep.</p> <p>Their alliance will collide with a fourth hero who arrived in the frontier town of Red Larch shortly after the three left town in search of the delegation:</p> <p>Ozeer yn Ibbram: a mercenary of Cormyr, born in the lush grasslands of the Border Kingdoms in southern Faerûn. Having never known his mother and with his father falling to a plague, Ozeer lived a life fighting in a variety of petty local wars. Setting out on his own, his journey has taken him north, where rumors of a group of sell swords occupy a keep in the Dessarin Valley.</p> <p>Not until events that have yet to unfold will draw the companions deeper into the shadows, forever changing their lives and shaping the fate of the world. No one expected them to be heroes. Least of all, themselves.</p> <p>Princes of the Apocalypse is a <a href=\"http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 5th edition adventure held monthly in the Outer Richmond District of San Francisco.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/d204life/events/222444447/","yes_rsvp_count":5,"duration":14400000,"name":"Princes of the Apocalypse – Game Session #2","id":"222444447","time":1433104200000,"updated":1431376688000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1398574311000,"name":"Downtown D&D","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"id":14128332,"urlname":"d204life","group_lat":37.790000915527344,"who":"Heroes"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"Berry Street","name":"Mission Creek Park Basketball Court","lon":-122.401817,"id":21587592,"state":"CA","lat":37.769131,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.036606788635254,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1428546926000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p>These courts are right by the sand volleyball court under the overpass.

It would be great for each person to being an appatizer to share. The cost is $8.00 per person and you get 4 tastings and get to keep the glass. Here is a little more about Viano Wineyards. www.vianowineyards.com</p> <p>Viano Winery</p> <p>Our century-old vineyard is nestled on hillsides surrounding a fertile little valley where cooling breezes from the Carquinez Straits provide the necessary balance of heat and coolness. Here in our valley, we have a proven combination of ideal soil and climatic conditions favorable for growing premium wine grapes. Included are Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, French Columbard, Muscat Canelli, Cabernet Sauvignon, Gamay, Petite Sirah, Sangiovese and Zinfandel.</p> <p>This Family Estate, now with its 3rd and 4th generations, was founded by the Viano family in 1920. They purchased the already planted vineyard which was established in 1888. It reminded them of their vineyards in Piedmont, Italy. This area, once so rich in grapes, was named Vine Hill and home to more than 15 wineries.</p> <p>Some of the original vines still remain while the balance of the vineyard has been expanded and replanted to keep up with new world tastes and desires.

Eddington begins, \"I have settled down to the task of writing these lectures and have drawn up my chairs to my two tables. Two tables! Yes; there are duplicates of every object about me - two tables, two chairs, two pens.\" One table is substantive, relatively permanent, has a certain color, etc. This is the everyday table. The other table is mostly empty space, has many parts which are electrically charged, etc. This is the scientific table. Graham Harman takes Eddington's lecture as his point of departure in his paper \"The Third Table.\" Harman claims that a critical element is missing in this seemingly overpopulated account of the one table as being two tables, an everyday and scientific table. The problem is that these are both ways in which the table appears to us. They are images in the mind; they're not real. There must be a third table, one which lies deeper than the everyday and scientific images. Eddington's two ways of accounting for phenomena is given an influential contemporary articulation in Wilfrid Sellars ideas of the manifest image and the scientific images. Come and join our tables as we delve into this great debate which spans from the philosophy of science to the philosophy of art.</p> <p><br/>This is round 2 of this topic.

Come ready to experience some magic, to feel blocks lifted and to experience some new energy in your life. </p> <p><b>Cost:</b> The cost of this event is $30 for the whole day paid directly to me.

The views from this trail will keep you breathless, ranging from rugged beach to the old Sutro Baths, to hills alive with wildflowers and twisted cypress trees, and even some great neighborhoods.</p> <p>Meet Point: Trouble Coffee &amp; Coconut Club (4033 Judah St.).<br/>Departure Time: 11:15AM<br/>We will walk the three blocks and cross over the Great Highway amid the dunes of Ocean Beach. Head north toward Cliff House. Mosey on to Land's End and the Sutro Baths, the beautiful ruins that we wish were still in tact! We will continue following the coastal trail along the cliffs, where jaw-dropping vistas promise a steady flow of hikers and runners. Take a breather (and an obligatory selfie) at the Eastern Coastal Trail Overlook, where we'll get your first look at the Golden Gate Bridge in all its glory. Then, keep following the Coastal Trail and veer north to the Eagle Point Labyrinth. Once we're back on the Coastal Trail, we'll pass through diverse plant life and past trails that branch off to Lincoln Park Golf Course and the Legion of Honor. The Land's End Trail will end at 32nd Avenue and El Camino Del Mar. Continuing on El Camino Del Mar, here we'll enter into a totally different terrain: The neighborhood of Sea Cliff, known for posh maisons. We will stay left on El Camino del Mar to continue onto Sea Cliff Avenue. If we turn left on 25th Avenue and keep right, we will see a small passage to Baker Beach. Climb the notorious Sand Ladder to Lincoln Blvd. to begin the Battery to Bluffs Trail on the left, which exposes stunning views of Sea Cliff, the Marin Headlands, and Baker Beach. You will pass by the Battery Crosby. The trail here is windy and steep with many stairs, but it blooms with coastal ground cover and offers some of most scenic landscapes in SF. At Battery Godfrey, an artillery platform built in 1895, climb the stairs on the right to the small park, where benches offer a welcome spot to take in the views of the Golden Gate. Next, walk down the stairs toward Storey Ave. to continue our way into the Presidio.<br/>The Finish Line:<br/>When we finally arrive at the Presidio Main Post Lawn, take off our shoes, cop a squat on the lawn, and give ourselves a pat on the back for conquering a seriously major urban hike. After the hike we have option to indulge at Transit Cafe (215 Lincoln Blvd.), is an indoor/outdoor must for easy grub, including breakfast burritos, salads, burgers and Neapolitan pies to eat in or take to go.</p>","event_url":"http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Hiking-Meetup-129290482EihTDVrv/events/222669033/","yes_rsvp_count":17,"name":"Urban Hike: Ocean Beach to the Presidio","id":"222669033","time":1433095200000,"updated":1432148670000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1409344192000,"name":"San Francisco Hiking Meetup","group_lon":-122.41999816894531,"id":16678462,"urlname":"San-Francisco-Hiking-Meetup-129290482EihTDVrv","group_lat":37.779998779296875,"who":"Members"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-25200000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"San Francisco","address_1":"Marina Boulevard","name":"Fort Mason Center","lon":-122.441002,"id":12966082,"state":"CA","lat":37.805965,"repinned":false},"headcount":0,"distance":10.347702026367188,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1432226310000,"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Please join us for a very special edition of Awakened Living Sunday!</b></p> <p><br/><b>Practitioners' Workshop</b></p> <p>facilitated by Rebecca Farrar and TJ Woodward</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>An incredible morning of connection, healing and love.</b></p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p>Are you interested in experiencing different healing modalities?</p> <p>Are you a holistic or spiritual practitioner looking to connect with other healers?</p> <p>Are you looking to share ideas and experiences of working in a \"helping\" profession?</p> <p>\n\n\nWorkshop is open to all, so whether you are a holistic practitioner, or looking to connect with a group of powerful healers, this workshop will be a wonderful opportunity to come together and grow!</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Sunday, May 31st</b></p> <p><b>11:00 AM - 12:30 PM</b></p> <p><b>Fort Mason Center - Building C - Room C205</b></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>THIS WORKSHOP WILL INCLUDE:</b></p> <p>• Interactive processes</p> <p><br/>• Lively discussions</p> <p><br/>• Sharing of ideas and practices</p> <p><br/>• Demonstrations of healing modalities</p> <p><b>PLEASE JOIN US!</b></p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Hosted By Awakened Living</b></p> <p>Awakened Living is a 21st century movement for people who consider themselves spiritual, but not religious, and have a deep hunger for personal and global transformation.</p> <p>We are a diverse group of like-minded people dedicated to joyous celebration, spiritual practice, and connected community.</p> <p>In spiritual and religious communities, people are often told what to believe.

(We'll pass a hat at the end for voluntary contributions.) Please join us for an exciting day of meeting growth-conscious lesbian and queer single women, and learning and practicing communicating &amp; dating skills! See below for details :)</b></p> <p><b>Single, and having trouble connecting with women you want to date? Or do you find yourself dating women who aren't right for you?</b></p> <p><br/><b>In this full day, highly experiential workshop, w</b><b>e’ll do lots of partner exercises that help you authentically connect with the other women in the room,</b> <b>while also preparing you for a deeper, more satisfying and </b><b><i>more successful </i>dating process.</b></p> <p>We’ll help you practice key pre-dating and dating communication skills, like:</p> <p>·  Unlocking the mysteries of chemistry and compatibility – and learning what qualities your potential mate <i>must have </i>if you want a happy, lasting relationship.</p> <p>·  How to handle your fear of rejection and connect with women in an authentic, satisfying way, regardless of whether or not they’re a good match for you., </p> <p>·  How to converse in ways that build appropriate levels of intimacy. (Most women either stay too distant, do an “self-revelation dump” that sabotages connection, or move too quickly into flirting/sexualized interaction, rather than developing true contact.)</p> <p>·   How to stay in your body and in touch with your own wants and needs during a date, while also finding out who the other woman really is!</p> <p><b><i>Since this is a workshop for singles, you may be wondering, “Will there be women who are ‘my type’ at the workshop?”</i></b></p> <p><br/>Our answer is: while we can’t predict the ages, physical types or other specifics of the women who will show up, we <i>can </i>predict that the women who show up will be women who want meaningful connection, are frustrated with “dating as usual,” and are looking for a better way.</p> <p>If sparks fly at the workshop, great! But we’d encourage you to consider the possibility that meeting like-minded women, getting clear about what to look for, and getting to practice having key dating conversations is just as important, if not more so!</p> <p>So, you might meet someone at the workshop whom you’d like to date. Or, you might meet fellow travelers or friends who can support you on the conscious dating path.  Either way, you’ll learn, have fun… and get closer to the love you want.</p> <p><br/>We'll meet from 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. and take a 75-minute break for lunch mid-day. You can bring a bag lunch and eat in the meeting space, or go out with new friends to one of the many restaurants and cafes in the area. </p> <p>See you there :)  </p> <p>Limited to 34 women - so reserve your spot soon!</p>","how_to_find_us":"Just a few blocks from MacArthur BART!

Turn right, walk up about a hundred yards and you will see a sign/staircase for the horseshoe pits.</p> <p>Rain days are at the Chinese Pavilion (the gazebo on the Stowe Lake island just past the waterfall).  It is a bit less muni friendly, but car parking should be available on the lake for those who travel that way.</p> <p>In it's favor, the location has nearby bathrooms, it feels more martial artsy, it can handle eight, is covered, so no rained out. But more importantly, great acoustics. It's bothered me practicing Sonny's stuff without music, this place solves that.</p> <p> </p> <p>I am going to start allowing folks to spar/play - a major gear-shift from the self-defense/combatives scenario approach I have used since I started organizing this group. It is strictly optional. I am going to require three classes before I let you play.</p> <p>The distinction I am making here is spar = without weapons, play = with trainer-weapons - rattan is basically banned.</p> <p>As always, no fight club, no dog brothers.</p> <p>(Several of you have taken exception to my no dog brothers rule, implying, \"we're not all idiots.\" After all, a guy trained by  subject of a dog brother documentary, Sonny Umpad, and fracking punk-rock anarchist icon, Frank Discussion, should delight in training you to take out guys with batons in riot gear. Sadly, this is not the case.</p> <p>The problem isn't the TFM or the dog-brothers, per say, the problem is its devotees tend to develop an attitude that becomes a problem.  The dog brother attitude/approach makes it difficult for some rare individuals within their ranks and on their periphery to know why they are training. Of the three people I've kicked to the curb/banned from this group, two fell into that category. The third was a mentally disturbed registered sex offender.</p> <p>Highly recommend watching the original Japanese \"Shall we dance,\" movie if you are still a bit confused about what I will and will not accept behavioral-wise.</p> <p> </p> <p>People of all levels and different Martial Arts systems are welcome to attend. I emphasize, safety first, movement, flow, with broken rhythm, basic techniques and JKD terminology/language.</p> <p> </p> <p>For those of you who don't know, <a href=\"http://www.nextbus.com\">www.nextbus.com</a> is a useful resource for getting around on Muni, but kinda sucks unless you already know what bus routes you need.</p> <p> </p> <p>Gavin</p> <p> </p>","how_to_find_us":"The Horseshoe Pits are inside the park at the Stanyan Hayes entrance.

We'll meet in the small parking lot at the trail head and hike to the lake where we'll have a seated meditation and lunch by the calm and serene lake.  In a field on our way back, Larissa will lead a creative and gentle yoga which is available to all levels.</p> <p><br/>The hike is about 8 miles with 1500 feet elevation gain.  As always, please bring water, lunch, your yoga mat, sunscreen and whatever else will make you most comfortable on this journey.  Unfortunately, the falls will not have much water at this time of year but the hike is beautiful and peaceful.  There are areas of both sun &amp; shade throughout the hike.

Drive about 5 miles west on Sir Francis Drake to Fairfax. Turn left on Pastori, right on Broadway, and left onto Fairfax-Bolinas Road. Drive about 4 miles on Fairfax-Bolinas Road to the parking lot on the left side of the road.  <br/>Spots to watch out for on Fairfax-Bolinas Road:  there will be a fork in the road to enter Bon Tempe lake, bear to the right in order to continue on Bolinas-Fairfax Rd for 1.5 miles.  You will pass a golf course on your left, about .5 miles up the hill will be a parking lot on the left side that fits about 20 cars.  The parking lot is on the top of the hill, if you start to go downhill again--you've driven too far.
